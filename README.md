# AngularLabs

This README file contains the default Angular CLI-generated content, plus the lab instructions for each step. Each lab step is tagged with a branch, so to start on the first lab, simply "git checkout master", examine the README file for the instructions, and begin.

## Lab 3: JokeListComponent




At this point, the domain models are finished. If you are not sure if you got it all to work, you can always fast-forward to the next lab by doing a `git checkout lab-4`.
