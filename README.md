# AngularLabs

This README file contains the default Angular CLI-generated content, plus the lab instructions for each step. Each lab step is tagged with a branch, so to start on the first lab, simply "git checkout master", examine the README file for the instructions, and begin. All instructions will be at the end of the README, so that developers can see what has gone before, and have this file as a reference point for reference purposes.

## Lab 4: 



## Congratulations

At this point, the domain models are finished. If you are not sure if you got it all to work, you can always fast-forward to the next lab by doing a `git checkout final`. It has our finalized solution; yours of course may be different.

## Future directions
There's a number of things you could do from here if you wanted to explore Angular in more depth:

* *Make JokeService use HTTP to get/set data from a web API.* Of course, you'll have to create the HTTP API, which is a whole different set of labs.
